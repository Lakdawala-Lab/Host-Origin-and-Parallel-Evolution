# Host-Origin-and-Parallel-Evolution
Repository for "Host origin is a determinant of parallel evolution between influenza virus gene segments" by Jones &amp; Lakdawala (bioRxiv 2022). Includes raw data and source code for analysis of parallel evolution between gene segments of human and avian influenza viruses.
## How to use this repository:
The code provided in this repository can be used to reconstruct and analyze convergence between phylogenetic trees of gene and protein sequences. Input FASTA files are provided as examples. Source code for tree reconstruction and analysis is broadly generalizable to any set of sequences and is presented separately from sequence processing and selection. 
# Folders
## 'Data'
This folder contains the raw data that were processed and analyzed in this study. This includes FASTA files sourced from the [Influenza Research Database](https://www.fludb.org/).
## 'Sequence Selection'
This folder contains source code for the initial processing of raw FASTA files and selection of sequences from different regions or hosts.
## 'Tree Reconstruction and Analysis'
This folder contains source code for tree reconstruction and tree distance calculation.
